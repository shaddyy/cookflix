<p>CookFlix is a recipe sharing website for you and all your friends! Currently, Cookflix is just getting started. Click the "Submit a Recipe" button to help contribute!</p>

<p>The goal for CookFlix is to be a centralized place to submit your recipes and browse what recipes other users have submitted. CookFlix has been optimized to run on mobile devices too! Browse recipes on the go or follow recipe instructions while cooking on your mobile device.</p>

<p>CookFlix would like to encourage users to submit health conscious recipes. When you submit a recipe you'll find that there are 4 optional fields you may fill out: Calories, Fats, Carbs, and Protein. If you submit these nutritonal facts it may help dieters that are trying to stricten their food intake! So add these as much as possible.</p>

<center><p>CookFlix is currently managed by Shaddy Zayour. Thank you for visiting the site!</p></center>
